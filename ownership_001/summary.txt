Ownership:
- An owner is a local variable that has exclusive ownership over a piece of memory.
- When that local variable is passed to a function or assigned to another variable, then ownership
  is "moved" to the new owner.
- The original variable can no longer be used.
- Owner is deallocated if ownership is not transferred once we exit
  the local scope of said variable

Variables:
- Everything is immutable by default.
- Have to opt in to mutability.

Borrowing:
- Uses references to prevent moving ownership. Original owner retains
  ownership.
- Two types of references a.k.a. "borrows":
  - Immutable borrow
  - Mutable borrow
